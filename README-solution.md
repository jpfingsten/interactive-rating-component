## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Being a new dev, I at first wanted to make the JavaScript logic a little complicated. After I realized that pretty much everything I needed could be included in a single click event, I went that route.

I waffled on whether or not to leave the card truly responsive or lock in its width on various screens using media queries. Ultimately, I ended up using media queries with "viewport width" units, and I think at all widths, it still looks pretty good.

### Continued development

I could have used jQuery or React to build this -- I'm really new to React, and this would have been a great exercise in simple state handling. May come back to it and resubmit it as a React component later on!

### Useful resources

Didn't use any memorable resources on this one.
